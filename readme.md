# Whiskey in Dublin

Interactive Frontend Development - Code Institute

This the website allows the user to find their favouire way of savour whiskey in Dublin. 

The website gives the user the chance to choose between distillieries, bars and the Irish Whiskey Museum.

From the menu in the header it is possible to quickly access all the areas of the page.

It is possible to see where the locations are directly on the map. 

## Demo
A live demo can be found [here](https://cipsim.github.io/Milestone-2-JS/).
 
## UX
 
My goal in the design was to easily allow the user to select an option and find it on the map.

- I want to do a tour in one of the distilleries, where can I find them?
- I just want to chill for a while in a pub savouring whiskey, what are my best options?
- Where is the Irish Wiskey Museum?
